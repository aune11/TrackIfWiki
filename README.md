# TrackIfWiki
An internal wiki for TrackIf; add and edit documentation.

This was a small internal wiki I started as an intern project while working at TrackIf LLC.  The site is unpolished in look, but is fully functional, with the ability to add, edit, and delete articles, and includes a primitive search function.  The Parsedown library for Markdown is used for styling article entries, and does require the user to be familiar with it, so a small guide was linked to on the submitDocument.php page.

Main change I would've made in this project would've been to utilize functions more and cut down on the individual number of pages.
